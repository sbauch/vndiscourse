#

#
# yaml::
#   Emit facts in YAML format.
#
# json::
#   Emit facts in JSON format.
#
# puppet::
#   Load the Puppet libraries, thus allowing Facter to load Puppet-specific facts.
#
# version::
#   Print the version and exit.
#
# help::
#   Print this help message.
#
# debug::
#   Enable debugging.

# Bundler and rubygems maintain a set of directories from which to
# load gems. If Bundler is loaded, let it determine what can be
# loaded. If it's not loaded, then use rubygems. But do this before
# loading any facter code, so that our gem loading system is sane.
