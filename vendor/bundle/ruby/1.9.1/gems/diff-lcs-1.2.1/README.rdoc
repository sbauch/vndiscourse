== Description

Diff::LCS computes the difference between two Enumerable sequences using the
McIlroy-Hunt longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm. It includes utilities
to create a simple HTML diff output format and a standard diff-like tool.

This is release 1.2.1, restoring the public API to what existed in Diff::LCS
1.1.x. Everyone is strongly encouraged to upgrade to this version as it fixes
all known outstanding issues.

== Synopsis

Using this module is quite simple. By default, Diff::LCS does not extend
objects with the Diff::LCS interface, but will be called as if it were a
function:

  require 'diff/lcs'

  seq1 = %w(a b c e h j l m n p)
  seq2 = %w(b c d e f j k l m r s t)

  lcs = Diff::LCS.LCS(seq1, seq2)
  diffs = Diff::LCS.diff(seq1, seq2)
  sdiff = Diff::LCS.sdiff(seq1, seq2)
  seq = Diff::LCS.traverse_sequences(seq1, seq2, callback_obj)
  bal = Diff::LCS.traverse_balanced(seq1, seq2, callback_obj)
  seq2 == Diff::LCS.patch!(seq1, diffs)
  seq1 == Diff::LCS.unpatch!(seq2, diffs)
  seq2 == Diff::LCS.patch!(seq1, sdiff)
  seq1 == Diff::LCS.unpatch!(seq2, sdiff)

Objects can be extended with Diff::LCS:

  seq1.extend(Diff::LCS)
  lcs = seq1.lcs(seq2)
  diffs = seq1.diff(seq2)
  sdiff = seq1.sdiff(seq2)
  seq = seq1.traverse_sequences(seq2, callback_obj)
  bal = seq1.traverse_balanced(seq2, callback_obj)
  seq2 == seq1.patch!(diffs)
  seq1 == seq2.unpatch!(diffs)
  seq2 == seq1.patch!(sdiff)
  seq1 == seq2.unpatch!(sdiff)

By requiring 'diff/lcs/array' or 'diff/lcs/string', Array or String will be
extended for use this way.

Note that Diff::LCS requires a sequenced enumerable container, which means that
the order of enumeration is both predictable and consistent for the same set of
data. While it is theoretically possible to generate a diff for an unordered
hash, it will only be meaningful if the enumeration of the hashes is
consistent. In general, this will mean that containers that behave like String
or Array will perform best.

== History

Diff::LCS is a port of Perl's Algorithm::Diff that uses the McIlroy-Hunt
longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm to compute intelligent differences
between two sequenced enumerable containers. The implementation is based on
Mario I. Wolczko's {Smalltalk version 1.2}[ftp://st.cs.uiuc.edu/pub/Smalltalk/MANCHESTER/manchester/4.0/diff.st]
(1993) and Ned Konz's Perl version
{Algorithm::Diff 1.15}[http://search.cpan.org/~nedkonz/Algorithm-Diff-1.15/].

This library is called Diff::LCS because of an early version of Algorithm::Diff
which was restrictively licensed.
