    subject_template: "[%{site_name}] Email Deliverability Test"
    text_body_template: |
      This is an email test from the %{site_name} forum. You can access this forum via your web browser at

      [*%{base_url}*][0]

      Email deliverability can be complex, but a few things you want to check immediately are:

      - Be sure you know how to view the *raw source of the email* in your mail client, so you can examine the email headers for important clues.

      - **IMPORTANT:** Does your ISP have a reverse DNS record entered to associate the domain name you mail from with the IPs you use to email? You can [test your Reverse PTR record][2] here. If the proper reverse DNS pointer record isn't entered by your ISP, it's very unlikely any of your email will be delivered.

      - Is your domain's SPF record correct? You can [test your SPF record][1] here.

      - Have you configured [DKIM email key signing][3] in your email software, and put the public DKIM key in your DNS records?

      - Have you checked to make sure the IPs of the server the mail originates from are [not on any email blacklists][4]?

      We hope you received this email deliverability test OK!

      Good luck,

      Your friends at %{site_name}.

      text_body_template: |
        Hello,
        
        This is an automated message from %{site_name} to inform you that the following post was hidden as a result of community flagging.

        %{base_url}%{url}

        Your post was hidden because it was flagged by the community.

        Keep in mind that multiple community members flagged this post before it was hidden, so please consider how you might revise your post to reflect their feedback.

        You can edit the post after %{edit_delay} minutes, and it will be automatically unhidden. This will increase your forum trust level.

        However, if the post is hidden by the community a second time, the moderators will be notified -- and there may be further action, including the possible suspension of your account.

        For additional guidance, please refer to our [FAQ](/faq).

    usage_tips:
      text_body_template: |
        This private message has a few quick tips to get you started:

        ### Keep Scrolling

        There is no next page button or page numbers -- to keep reading, just keep scrolling down, and more content will load!

        As new replies come in, they will appear automatically at the bottom of the topic. No need to refresh the page or re-enter the topic to see new posts.

        ### How Do I Reply?

        - To reply to a specific post, use the Reply button at the bottom of that post.

        - If you want to reply to the overall *theme* of the topic, rather than any specific person in the topic, use the Reply button at the very bottom of the topic.

        - If you want to take the conversation in a different direction, but keep them linked together, use Reply as New Topic to the right of the post.

        ### Who is Talking to Me?

        When someone replies to your post, quotes you, or mentions your @username, a notification will appear at the top of the page. Click or tap the notification number to see who's talking to you, and where. Join the conversation!

        - To mention someone's name, start typing `@` and an autocompleter will pop up.

        - To quote an entire post, use the Import Quote button on the composer toolbar.

        - To quote just a section of a post, highlight it, then click the Reply button that appears over the highlight.

        ### Look at That Post!

        To let someone know that you enjoyed their post, click the like button at the bottom of the post. If you see a problem with a post, don't hesitate to click the flag button and let the moderators -- and your fellow community members -- know about it.

        ### Where am I?

        - To get back to the home page at any time, **click the icon at the upper left.**

        - To search, visit your user page, or otherwise navigate, click on the icons at the upper right.
        - While reading a topic, you can move to the top by clicking its title at the top of the page. To reach the *bottom*, click the down arrow on the topic progress indicator at the bottom of the page, or click the last post field on the topic summary under the first post.
